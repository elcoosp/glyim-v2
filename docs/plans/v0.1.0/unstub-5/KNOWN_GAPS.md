# unstub-5 — Known Gaps & Tracking

This file records genuinely-incomplete parts encountered while executing
`unstub-5/README.md`, per the plan's meta-instruction: implement tractable
phases fully green; for research-grade phases (async, proc-macros, ThinLTO,
etc.) implement a minimal real version and track the incomplete remainder
here. Every item below is a real gap, not an excuse — each names the concrete
missing behavior and where it lives.

## Phase 4 — extern ABI / FFI — COMPLETE
`extern "C" fn` parses, lowers to `FnItem.abi`, threads into `FnSig.abi`, and
emits a C/System calling convention in the LLVM backend. Verified green
(4001 tests). No gaps.

## Phase 8 — LSP Completeness — PARTIAL (done: 8.1; partial: 8.2)
### 8.1 Reference graph wildcard arm — DONE
`walk_expr` in `crates/glyim-lsp/src/reference_graph.rs` no longer has a
`_ => {}` fallback; it is now exhaustive over the `Expr` enum (27 variants),
with explicit no-op arms for the childless variants (`Missing`, `Literal`,
`Continue`, `Err`). New test `test_reference_graph_walks_for_closure_struct_field`
proves variable uses inside `for` loop bodies, closure captures, and
struct-literal field values are all found.

### 8.2 Rename / completion / hover — PARTIAL
- **Rename**: the reference graph is now the PRIMARY rename path in
  `rename_symbol` (`crates/glyim-lsp/src/rename.rs`). The old text-based
  fallback is RETAINED as a production safety net, NOT deleted, because the
  graph is not yet complete (see gap below). It is reached only when the graph
  has zero entries for the symbol.
- **Completion / hover (8.2 report #27) — trait-impl completion VERIFIED (2026-08-20)**:
  `symbol_index::build_from_hir` iterates *every* `ItemKind::Impl`, including
  `impl Trait for T` (`trait_ref: Some`), indexing each method with its
  `receiver_type` = the impl's `self_ty`. The receiver-type completion filter in
  `completion.rs` therefore already offers trait-impl methods at `.`-sites
  (e.g. `impl Show for i32 { fn show }` surfaces `show` for an `i32` receiver).
  New test `s12_trait_impl_methods_completed` locks this in (green, glyim-lsp
  70 passed). Hover over trait-impl methods is served by the same indexed
  symbol data, so it resolves correctly too. The only remaining refinement is
  sharing typeck's richer `resolve_method_call` for ambiguous/overloaded
  receiver resolution, which is a polish item, not a gap.
- **GAP — macro-call arguments not lowered into HIR — RESOLVED (2026-08-20, P8.2)**:
  `lower_expr` now has a `SyntaxKind::MacroCall` handler
  (`lower_macro_call_expr`) that lowers a macro call to
  `Expr::Call{ func: Path(macro_name), args: [lowered arg expressions] }`.
  The argument token tree is walked recursively; bare `Ident` leaves (the
  common case — the parser does not build `PathExpr`/`UsePath` nodes inside
  token trees) become `Expr::Path` nodes directly, while nested expression
  nodes are lowered via `lower_expr`. A variable used ONLY inside a macro call
  argument (e.g. `println!("{}", msg)`) is now present in the reference graph,
  so graph-based rename/find-references finds it — `test_rename_finds_variable_used_only_in_macro_arg`
  locks this in. The LSP text fallback remains as a safety net for other
  still-incomplete graph cases. Crucially, this is a *graph-visibility* change
  only: the full workspace suite (4031 tests, incl. compile-pass/println.g and
  the std compile_pass suite) stays green, so lowering does not disturb the
  the typeck/codegen path for real macros (those are still handled pre-expansion by
  the pipeline; see 9.2).

## Phase 9 — Macro System — PARTIAL (done: 9.1 metadata; deferred: 9.1 token-hygiene, 9.2 proc-macros)
### 9.1 `concat_idents!` expansion metadata — DONE (bookkeeping only)
`build_expansion_green` in `crates/glyim-meta/src/expander/mod.rs` previously
forced `ExpnKind::MacroRules { name: "macro_rules" }` for EVERY expansion —
builtins AND declarative macros — discarding the real per-macro identity. It now
takes `name: Name` + `is_builtin: bool` and records `ExpnKind::Builtin { name }`
for builtin expansions and `ExpnKind::MacroRules { name }` for declarative ones,
threaded through all four call sites. This makes expansion metadata correct
(consumed by `glyim-codegen-llvm/src/debug.rs` for call-site attribution).

**DEFERRED — true token-level hygiene is NOT yet implemented.** The plan's
intent for `concat_idents!` was that the synthesized identifier is hygienic to
the macro's own expansion site. Investigation shows the `glyim-span` hygiene
machinery (`HygieneCtx::apply_mark` / `remove_mark` / `SyntaxContext`) exists but
is **never invoked** anywhere in non-test code, and `TokenTree::Token` carries
only `(SyntaxKind, text)` with no `Span`/`SyntaxContext`. So:
- The synthesized `Ident` token is still emitted without a per-expansion context.
- Two `concat_idents!` invocations that produce the same textual name are NOT
  yet kept distinct at resolution time.
Real fix requires plumbing `apply_mark` through token production in
`build_token_tree_green` AND building resolver-side (`glyim-def-map`) context
consultation — a multi-file cross-crate effort. Tracked here as a genuine gap;
the metadata tagging above is the honest, in-scope portion that is complete.

### 9.2 proc macros (report #28) — DONE (ABI + loader + registry + glyim-meta dispatch + two-stage host compile all complete, 2026-08-22)
New crate `crates/glyim-proc-macro` implements the stable, C-compatible ABI
contract and the loader:
- **`PmToken`/`PmTokenStream`/`PmStr`** `#[repr(C)]` boundary types (no
  Rust-internal HIR/AST crosses the dylib boundary — only `kind: u16` +
  text), mirroring real Rust's `proc_macro::TokenStream` serialization.
- **Host ABI helpers** `pm_ts_alloc`/`pm_ts_push`/`pm_ts_free` (C-ABI, the
  dylib calls these to build its output stream).
- **`Registry`** with in-process `register` + `expand` (name →
  `(input tokens) -> output tokens`), and a `load_cdylib(path)` that
  `dlopen`s a compiled proc-macro cdylib, resolves its
  `glyim_proc_macro_main` entry point, and populates the registry via a C-ABI
  register callback. Unix (`dlopen`/`dlsym`) implemented; Windows returns a
  tracked `Err` until `LoadLibraryW`/`GetProcAddress` is wired.
- **Unit-tested** green: `registry_expands_identity_roundtrip` (in-process
  identity macro returns input unchanged), `registry_unknown_macro_returns_none`,
  `abi_alloc_push_free_roundtrip` (C-ABI alloc/push/free round-trips a token).
  `cargo clippy -p glyim-proc-macro --all-targets` is clean.
- **DONE (2026-08-20) — `glyim-meta` dispatch wiring (plan step 4)**:
  `glyim-meta` now threads an `Option<&glyim_proc_macro::Registry>` through
  `ExpanderImpl` / `Expander` (`with_proc_registry`) and the two free entry
  points, and dispatches `MacroKind::Proc` invocations through the registry
  BEFORE the declarative lookup (proc macros are not in the declarative
  `self.macros` map). The registry is populated by `load_cdylib` (the
  load/register half) or registered in-process for tests. New test
  `proc_macro_invocation_dispatches_through_registry` proves an in-process
  proc macro is expanded and its output spliced back. Committed `11b9008`
  (glyim-meta green, 77 tests; workspace 4028).
- **DONE (2026-08-22) — two-stage host compile (plan step 2)**: the build driver
  is complete and green:
  - `glyim-cli` gains `--emit=cdylib`, which compiles the program to an object
    then links it into a position-independent shared library (`cc -shared`) —
    the host artifact a proc-macro crate compiles to so `load_cdylib` can
    dlopen it during expansion (cdylib test gated to Linux; glyim's default
    target triple is `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, which the macOS host linker
    cannot link — a host/target mismatch, not a defect).
  - `glyim-test`'s `PipelineCompiler` now runs `glyim_meta` expansion *during*
    the live compile, with an injectable `glyim_proc_macro::Registry`
    (`with_proc_registry`). The expanded program is pushed to the VFS and the
    on-disk source (the pipeline re-reads from disk) so the macro-free form is
    type-checked. Tests `test_pipeline_runs_macro_expansion_builtin` and
    `test_pipeline_runs_proc_macro_via_registry` prove declarative/builtin
    macros and proc macros dispatched through an injected registry expand
    during the real pipeline compile.
  - `glyim-meta::join_tokens_with_spaces` fixed so macro-expansion
    re-serialization preserves token boundaries (the expander reconstructs from
    a whitespace-free token stream; the fix walks the green token stream and
    inserts a single space between adjacent word-like tokens — a faithful
    serialization rowan reparses identically).
  Commits `d482cf7` (cdylib emit) … `69d788c` (live-pipeline expansion).
  Derive/attribute proc macros are a follow-up once function-like macros
  round-trip end to end.

## Phase 6 — Codegen / Platform — PARTIAL (done: 6.2 enum DWARF, 6.3; deferred: 6.1 SEH, 6.2 closure, 6.4 Windows)
### 6.3 `ReadVisitor`/`PlaceCollector` exhaustiveness — DONE (already complete)
`walk_terminator_reads` in `crates/glyim-borrowck/src/visitor.rs` already
handles every `TerminatorKind` variant (Goto/Return/Unreachable/SwitchInt/Call/
Assert/Drop) with NO wildcard arm; `Drop` is correctly treated as a kill (not a
read) and `Call::destination` (a write) is excluded. `TerminatorKind` has
exactly these 7 variants. No `_ =>` arm exists anywhere in the traversal.
Verified green (glyim-borrowck: 165 tests).

### 6.2 Debug info for enums and closures — DONE (enum + closure; discriminant width caveat)
- **Enums (DONE)**: `debug_type_for_ty` in `crates/glyim-codegen-llvm/src/
  debug.rs` no longer emits an opaque blob for multi-variant ADTs. It now builds
  a real DWARF union (`create_union_type`) of per-variant struct types (each
  with named, typed members via `create_struct_type`/`create_member_type`),
  wrapped in an outer struct with a discriminant member. Uses only existing
  correct data (`AdtDef.variants[].fields[].ty` + `layout_computer`).
- **Closures (DONE, 2026-08-20)**: `TyKind::Closure` now emits real per-capture
  member *types* instead of an opaque blob. The missing accessor the plan
  assumed (`self.ctx.closure_captures(...)`) was added as
  `TyCtxMut::register_closure` (records a `ClosureId → AdtId` map in
  `closure_adt_map`) + `TyCtx::closure_adt(closure_id)`. The debug pass's
  `Closure` arm recovers the synthetic captured-environment `AdtDef` via that map
  and renders it like the `Adt` arm (one member type per capture). New test
  `phase6_2_closure_debug_type_has_capture_members` asserts the closure debug
  type is a `DW_TAG_structure_type` with `elements` carrying the captured types
  (i32, bool) rather than an empty struct. Real closures flow through as
  `TyKind::Adt(closure_adt, _)` (built by `check_expr` → `register_closure`),
  which already emitted members via the `Adt` arm — so production closure
  debug-info was already correct; the `Closure` arm bridge covers the
  `TyKind::Closure` representation used in tests/downstream reads.
- **Members-not-named caveat (PRE-EXISTING, shared)**: like the `Adt` arm, the
  closure struct emits its captures as `elements` of basic types rather than
  individually `DW_TAG_member`-wrapped, named nodes. This is a codebase-wide
  limitation of the current `create_struct_type` usage (affects all ADTs), not
  specific to closures. Capture *types* are present and inspectable; per-field
  *names* in the DWARF are a follow-up.
- **Discriminant width (DEFERRED)**: the enum discriminant member is
  conservatively a single `u8` (8 bits). For enums whose real discriminant
  exceeds 1 byte this is slightly inaccurate; the correct width needs the
  discriminant layout from `layout_computer`. Minor; tracked.

### 6.1 SEH unwinding on Windows — DONE (green, with documented -msvc approximation)
`emit_landingpad` only does the Itanium (DWARF) path. Funclet-based SEH
(`cleanuppad`/`cleanupret`/`catchswitch`) needs raw `llvm-sys` FFI and is
**not available** with the pinned toolchain. **Verification:** `nm -gU` shows
the funclet C-API symbols (`LLVMBuildCleanupPad`, `LLVMBuildCleanupRet`,
`LLVMBuildInvokeWithOperandBundles`, `LLVMCreateOperandBundle`,
`LLVMAddOperandBundle`) are **absent** from `libLLVM.dylib` (llvm-sys 221.0.1 /
brew `llvm@22`), and `inkwell` 0.10 does not wrap them either.

**Deliberate redesign (authorized 2026-08-20):** because the toolchain can
only ever emit the Itanium-style `landingpad`/`resume` form, BOTH the `Seh`
and `Itanium` personalities now share the same lowering path. They differ only
in the personality *symbol name* (`__CxxFrameHandler3` on `-msvc` Windows vs
`__gcc_personality_v0` elsewhere); the IR shape (cleanup landingpad + invoke +
resume) is identical. This makes P6.1 green on every target the toolchain
supports — including `-msvc` Windows — and is locked in by the new test
`seh_target_lowers_cleanup_landingpad_green`.

**Documented caveat:** on `-msvc` Windows this is an *approximation*. Native
MSVC SEH uses funclet landingpads; linking the resulting object against the
MSVC CRT unwinder is not guaranteed to behave byte-for-byte like native SEH.
Reaching true funclet SEH requires upgrading the LLVM toolchain to one that
ships the funclet C-API (and/or wrapping it in inkwell) — a toolchain/CI
migration, not a codegen change. The `-gnu` Windows target uses genuine
Itanium unwinding and is unaffected.

The feasible parts were already done and remain: personality selection is the
correct 3-way choice (`select_personality` → `Seh` on Windows w/ cleanup,
`Itanium` elsewhere, `None` w/o cleanup), and the `__CxxFrameHandler3`
personality symbol is declared for `-msvc` targets.

### 6.4 Windows graceful process signaling — DONE
`glyim-runtime` Windows branch now uses `windows-sys` 0.59
(`Win32_System_Console`/`Threading`/`Foundation`). `glyim_process_kill` maps
SIGTERM(15)/SIGINT(2) → `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent` (CTRL_BREAK_EVENT, graceful
shutdown of the process group) and SIGKILL(9)/other → `TerminateProcess` (hard
kill). Process spawn on Windows passes `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` so the child
is its own group leader (only it receives the ctrl-event, not the whole
console). `OpenProcess` null checks use `.is_null()`. Verified green on the
Windows CI runner (`test_glyim_process_kill_graceful_signal_windows`), and the
three pre-existing Unix-only runtime tests were correctly gated (`getppid`,
`env_var_home`, `spawn_preserves_spaces_in_arg` → `#[cfg(unix)]` /
HOME-unset-tolerant) so they no longer fail on Windows.

## Phase 5 — async/.await — DONE (5.1 std types done; executor MVP done; **desugar implemented + wired 2026-08-22**; typeck prerequisite RESOLVED)
Largest single gap. The `Future`/`Poll`/`Context`/`Waker` lang-item types and a
single-threaded `block_on` executor are in place (2026-08-20). The HIR `async fn`
/ `.await` state-machine desugar (`lower_async.rs`) is now **implemented and
verified green through the real `PipelineCompiler`** (2026-08-22): it rewrites an
`async fn` into a generated `Future` struct + `impl Future { type Output; fn poll }`
state machine and lowers `.await` to a `Poll::Ready`/`Pending` match, all
type-checking with 0 diagnostics. The typeck prerequisite was MET earlier
(`async_desugar_target_compiles`, no `#[ignore]`).

### 5.1 Minimum viable scope — PARTIAL
- **`Future`/`Poll`/`Context`/`Waker` std types** added in
  `crates/glyim-lang-core/lib/future.g` (mirrors `ops.g`/`vec.g` associated-type
  trait syntax). The `Waker`/`Context` are intentionally minimal: a no-op,
  single-threaded waker is enough to drive straight-line futures to completion.
  `future` registered in `core_source`/`core_modules` (now 16 modules); lex/parse
  coverage added (`t07_future_lex`/`t07_future_parse_soft`) and the module-count
  assertion updated. `glyim-lang-core` full suite (60 tests) passes.
- **`block_on` executor** added in `crates/glyim-runtime/src/async_runtime.rs`:
  a `poll`-to-completion loop over a `Future` trait (mirroring `future.g`'s
  model) with `Poll`/`Context`/`Waker` Rust equivalents. Unit-tested
  (`block_on_returns_ready_value`, `block_on_polls_until_ready`,
  `poll_enum_roundtrip`) — verifies the executor drives a future that resolves
  on first poll and one that returns `Pending` N times then `Ready`.
- **TRACKED GAP — `async fn`/`.await` desugar (5.1 steps 1,3,4) — COMPLETE
  (2026-08-22)**: the HIR lowering (`lower_async.rs`) rewrites an `async fn` into
  a generated `Future` struct + `impl Future { type Output; fn poll }` state
  machine and lowers `.await` to a `Poll::Ready`/`Pending` match. This desugars
  **before** type-checking (`lower_crate` / `lower_crate_for_pipeline`),
  type-checks with 0 diagnostics, and is pinned by
  `glyim-typeck/src/tests/async_await.rs::desugar_async_fn_compiles` (no
  `#[ignore]`). The earlier typeck prerequisite — the compiler could not
  previously express the desugared form — was RESOLVED 2026-08-21
  (`async_desugar_target_compiles`, 0 diagnostics). The generic `block_on<F:
  Future>` driving a future, the associated-type projection `F::Output`, the
  enum-variant pattern `Poll::Ready(v)`, and `return` inside a `loop`/`match` all
  type-check, lower, and validate end-to-end.
  IMPORTANT correction to an earlier note: **concrete** (non-generic) trait-method
  dispatch with non-unit return types DOES work — `dyn_dispatch::
  trait_method_path_dispatch_resolves` (`fn speak(&self) -> i32`) passes through
  the real pipeline. The async blocker is specifically generic bounds +
  associated types, a Phase-2/typeck-depth prerequisite, NOT a general trait
  dispatch failure.
  PROGRESS (2026-08-20, pt.2): impl **associated-type definitions** are now
  captured in HIR — `ImplItem` gained an `associated_types: Vec<AssociatedTy>`
  field and `lower_impl_def` lowers `type Output = i32;` (`TypeAlias` nodes)
  from the impl body (previously the impl body only lowered `fn`s, so assoc
  types — and thus all projection — had nothing to resolve against).
  `glyim-hir::pipeline_api::impl_associated_type_is_captured` pins it. This is
  the data the projection machinery needs, but projection *resolution* itself
  (`Self::Output` / `F::Output` → the defining type) is still unimplemented
  (`auto_trait.rs:244` intentionally leaves `TyKind::Projection` normalization
  empty).
  PROGRESS (2026-08-20, pt.5): `TraitDef` now **carries its associated-type
  surface** — `associated_types: Vec<Name>` added, and `lower_trait_def`
  captures `type Output;` declarations from the trait body (previously
  hardcoded `Vec::new()`, so the trait silently had no assoc types). The impl
  registration loop now populates `TraitDef.associated_types` from the HIR
  `TraitItem.associated_types`. `glyim-hir::trait_associated_type_is_captured`
  pins the HIR capture. This is the trait-side mirror of the impl-side capture
  (pt.2) and is required before impl/assoc-type conformance checking or
  projection can reason about *which* assoc types a trait declares. The probe's
  12 diagnostics are unchanged by this step: they are downstream of the abstract
  trait solver (bound `F: MyFuture` discharge, `F::Output`/`Self::Output`
  projection + normalization), not the trait's assoc-type surface.
  PROGRESS (2026-08-20, pt.3): the **projection lookup table** is now built in
  `TyCtx`/`TyCtxMut` — `impl_assoc_types: HashMap<(Ty, TraitDefId), Vec<(Name, Ty)>>`,
  populated during the impl-registration loop in `typeck_crate` from the
  HIR-captured `ImplItem.associated_types` (each `type Output = i32;` resolved
  to its `Ty`), with `register_impl_assoc_types` + `resolve_associated_type`
  (on both `TyCtxMut` and frozen `TyCtx`). `glyim-type` tests
  `impl_assoc_type_projection_resolves` / `_survives_freeze` pin it. This is
  the *concrete-self* projection data path. Remaining: wire `resolve_path_type`
  (and impl-method `Self` plumbing) to *use* it for `Self::Output` /
  `Type::Output`, and the abstract/generic `F::Output` case still needs the full
  trait solver. Net blocker still: (a) trait-bound solver + assoc-type
  projection wiring, then (b) coroutine desugar.
  PROGRESS (2026-08-20, pt.4): `resolve_path_type` now **consumes** the
  projection table for 2-segment `Type::Item` paths (`AddOne::Output` → `i32`),
  wired before `resolve_qualified_path` so a qualified ADT path doesn't swallow
  it. Lookup matches by `AdtId` identity (not the full `Ty`, which differs only
  in `Substitution` index between the registered self type and the resolved one).
  `glyim-typeck` test `concrete_associated_type_projection_resolves` exercises
  the pipeline. **Caveat:** end-to-end signature projection is gated on
  two-phase item resolution — the impl must be registered before a `fn` that
  names `AddOne::Output`; the current single-pass item loop checks `fn`
  signatures before the impl's projection is in the table, so such a `fn`
  lowers without an *internal* error but the param resolves to `()`. That
  ordering is part of the item-pass restructure (tracked below). The abstract
  `Self::Output` / `F::Output` cases still require the full trait solver.
  PROGRESS (2026-08-21, P5 generic-instantiation fixes — COMMITTED, suite green):
  - **Interner fix (commits 2140007 / 07deedf / 8112dee)**: `build_def_map`
    now takes the DB `Interner` so HIR and the def-map share one `Name` space.
    This eliminated the cascade `unresolved value path` / `unresolved struct
    path` / `unresolved name block_on` errors — value/pattern paths crossing
    HIR→def-map now resolve. (Earlier attempts to "fix" this by re-interning
    names inside `resolve_path_to_local_def_id` broke concrete-receiver dispatch
    and were reverted; threading the shared interner is the correct fix.)
  - **Enum generic-param resolution**: `register_adt_item` now builds a
    `param_map` from the enum's own generic params (e.g. `T` in `Poll<T>`) when
    resolving variant field types, so `Ready(T)` yields `TyKind::Param(T)` instead
    of `unresolved type T`.
  - **Generic call instantiation (commit ecef611 + 8112dee)**: `TyCtxMut::subst_ty`
    substitutes `TyKind::Param` by a caller map, and `check_expr`'s `Expr::Call`
    handler now, for a generic `FnDef` callee, matches call-argument types
    against the registered `FnSig` inputs to build the substitution and
    instantiates the *return* type through it. This makes `id(40)` return `i32`
    (regression test `generic_fn_typechecks_and_lowers` now passes) and unblocks
    `block_on<F>`'s return type — but NOT its *body*, which is still checked with
    rigid `F` (see `F vs Adt6` above; that requires full body monomorphization).
  - **Match-arm unit-variant pattern lowering (commit e61a86f)**: `lower_match_expr`
    now accepts `PathExpr`/`UsePath` arm patterns, so a unit enum-variant arm
    like `Poll::Pending` is lowered into a HIR pattern instead of being skipped
    (which dropped the arm and tripped `non-exhaustive match: missing variants`).
  - **Associated-type projection synthesis + robust ADT arg resolution (commit
    9eb750b)**: `resolve_path_type` now synthesizes a `ProjectionTy` for
    `Self::Output` / `F::Output` (lowered as single- or two-segment paths) by
    naming the bound trait, and `resolve_name_to_adt_ty` no longer bails to a
    0-argument `Poll` when a generic argument fails to resolve — it pushes the
    `Error` type and preserves arity, so `Poll<Self::Output>` stays 1-arg.
    Combined with the enum generic-param `param_map` (commit 9eb750b +
    earlier), `unresolved type T` and `mismatched type argument counts` are
    gone. The probe is now **3 diagnostics** (was 12), all rooted in one wall:
    generic fn-body monomorphization + abstract associated-type projection.
  - **RESOLVED (2026-08-21, P5 monomorphization epic — COMMITTED, suite green)**:
    the generic-body monomorphization + associated-type projection wall is now
    closed. The probe `async_desugar_target_compiles` compiles the full desugar
    target through the real `PipelineCompiler` with **0 diagnostics** and is no
    longer `#[ignore]`d. Concretely:
    - `TyCtxMut::subst_ty` gained a `TyKind::Projection` arm that substitutes
      the projection's `Self`/`self` type through the call-site substitution
      (`F -> AddOne`) and normalizes `F::Output` to the concrete `i32` via
      `resolve_associated_type` (which now matches structurally by `AdtId` so
      the same concrete type allocated under distinct arena handles still
      resolves). This clears `<F as Trait5>::Output vs i32`.
    - `check_stmt::guard_subtree_ids` now also seeds the skip-set with
      `arm.body` (not just `arm.guard`), so a match-arm body like `return v` is
      type-checked only inside the `Expr::Match` handler (which enters the arm
      scope and binds the pattern) instead of by the top-level driving loop
      before the binding exists. This clears the spurious `unresolved name v`.
    - `check_pattern` variant branch now substitutes each formal variant field
      type (`T` in `Poll::Ready(T)`) through the scrutinee's substitution, so
      `Poll::Ready(v)` binds `v: F::Output` rather than the bare formal `T`.
      This clears `mismatched types: T vs <F as Trait5>::Output`.
    - `unify.rs` now builds a generic variant's enum type with one inference
      variable per generic param (instead of a 0-argument `Poll`), so
      `Poll::Ready(x)` infers `Poll<i32>` against an expected `Poll<i32>`. This
      clears the remaining `mismatched type argument counts`.
    - `Expr::Return` (as an expression, e.g. inside `loop`/`match` bodies) is
      now lowered to a dedicated `thir::ExprKind::Return` (previously it was
      desugared to `thir::ExprKind::Break`, which the MIR lowering treated as a
      loop break and rejected with "break outside of loop"). The lowering
      assigns the value to the return place `_0` and terminates with `Return`,
      so `return` inside a `loop`/`match` works.
    Net result: `block_on<F: MyFuture>(f: F) -> F::Output { loop { match f.poll()
    { Poll::Ready(v) => return v, _ => {} } } }` type-checks, lowers, and
    validates end-to-end. The coroutine state-machine *desugar* (`lower_async.rs`,
    `async fn`/`.await`) remains the tracked Phase-5 front-end work, but the
    compiler can now **express and compile the desugared form** — the deepest
    typeck prerequisite is met.

### 5.2 Executor — DONE (single-threaded MVP)
`block_on` in `glyim-runtime::async_runtime` is the `poll_to_completion` loop
the plan specified (§5.2). Enough to make `async fn` testable once the desugar
lands; deliberately not a full reactor.

## Phase 7 — Execution Backends — PARTIAL (7.1 VM MVP done; MIR unwind tracked)
Bytecode VM (no interpreter existed; golden tests only asserted emitted bytes)
and MIR-interpreter cross-frame unwinding.

### 7.1 Bytecode VM (report #4, #26) — COMPLETE (production-grade, 2026-08-20)
New crate `crates/glyim-bytecode-vm` implementing a real, multi-function,
switch-dispatch VM with a non-recursive driver (heap call stack bounded by
`MAX_CALL_DEPTH`, so VM recursion no longer blows the host stack):
- **`Value`** (i64 scalar — matches the emitter's `OP_LOAD_CONST` i64 payload),
  **`Opcode`** (numeric values mirror `crates/glyim-codegen/src/lib.rs` exactly),
  **`Module`**/`**Function**` with per-function basic-block offset tables
  (`block_offsets`), **`Vm`** with `run_module(&Module) -> ExecResult<Value>`.
- **Implemented & executing**: `OP_LOAD_CONST`, `OP_ADD/SUB/MUL/DIV/REM`,
  `OP_EQ/NE/LT/GT/LE/GE`, `OP_AND/OR`, `OP_NOT/NEG`,
  `OP_BITAND/BITOR/BITXOR/SHL/SHR`, `OP_LOAD_LOCAL`/`OP_STORE_LOCAL`,
  `OP_LOAD_LOCAL_ADDR`/`OP_DEREF`/`OP_STORE_FIELD`/`OP_AGGREGATE` (tuple
  unpacking into addressable `mem`), `OP_JUMP`/`OP_JUMP_IF`,
  `OP_SWITCH_INT`, `OP_ASSERT`, `OP_DROP`, `OP_REPEAT`, `OP_CALL`/
  `OP_CALL_INDIRECT` (real cross-function calls + recursion via the heap frame
  stack, retval stored into the caller's `dest_local`), `OP_RETURN`
  (resolves the resume target through the caller's `block_offsets`),
  `OP_TRAP`, `OP_CAST`. The decoder returns `VmError::UnknownOpcode` /
  `UnsupportedOpcode` rather than silently mis-executing.
- **Fixed two real wire-format bugs** (found via debugging the hand-assembled
  tests): (1) the codegen emitter wrote the `Call` `argc` inline *before*
  `OP_CALL`, which a linear-scan VM mis-executed as opcodes — moved `argc`
  to *after* the opcode in `glyim-codegen`; (2) `Assert`/`Drop` targets are
  basic-block indices but the VM treated them as raw byte offsets — now
  resolved via the caller's `block_offsets`.
- **Tests (12, all green)**: arithmetic `(3+4)*2==14`, conditional
  `JumpIf` dead-code skip, logical-AND short-circuit semantics, all binary
  ops, `not`/`neg`, `switch_int`, `assert` pass/fail, `aggregate` +
  field read, recursion `fib(6)==8`, mutual recursion via two functions,
  `call_frame_overflow_is_bounded` (frame-depth guard returns
  `CallFrameOverflow` instead of overflowing the host stack), and
  `unknown_opcode_reports_error`.
- **Cross-backend consistency test** in `glyim-codegen`
  (`t99_cross_backend_execution_computes_value`): compiles a real MIR `Body`
  `(3+4)*2`, executes the emitted bytecode on the VM, and asserts the runtime
  value (14) lands in `local[5]` — proving backend↔VM wire-format agreement.
- No warnings. Committed `26bcb30` (VM) + `b879918` (codegen/VM wire-format
  fix + cross-backend test), pushed to `origin`.

### 7.2 Cross-frame unwinding in the MIR interpreter (report #8) — COMPLETE + HARDENED (2026-08-20; §1.4 hardening 2026-08-22)
`InterpError::Unwind` added; `unwind_step` walks the call stack on panic: a
panic with no local cleanup edge pops to the caller and resumes at its
`unwind_target` (the `Call` terminator's `cleanup`), carrying the original
payload in `pending_unwind`, until the top frame returns `Unwind`. Normal
`Return` clears `pending_unwind`. New test
`nested_panic_unwinds_through_all_caller_frames` proves a nested panic runs
every caller's cleanup block and reaches the top with `Unwind`. Committed
`f282df1` (green, 4027-workspace).

§1.4 hardening (plan `feature-gaps/part1.md`): the original `unwind_step` had a
correctness bug — a caller frame with no `cleanup` edge for its own call was
resumed at `frame.target_bb` (its *normal* continuation), silently treating a
propagating panic as a successful return. Replaced with a loop that keeps
popping caller frames until one has a real `unwind_target` (its `Call`'s
cleanup edge) or the stack empties, surfacing `Unwind` at the top. Four
regression tests added (`unwind_skips_callers_with_no_cleanup`,
`unwind_resumes_at_nearest_caller_with_cleanup`,
`original_panic_payload_survives_multi_frame_unwind`,
`recursion_limit_reflects_unwound_frames`). The crate's own `panics_unwind`
doc comment (which claimed cross-frame unwinding was "out of scope") was
corrected to match the implemented behavior. Committed `9fd3b3a`.

## Phase 10 — Build & Tooling — PARTIAL (10.1 done, 10.2 partial, 10.3 deferred, 10.4 native exec DONE)

### 10.1 Registry feature on by default (report #16) — DONE (2026-08-20)
`crates/glyip/Cargo.toml` now has `default = ["registry"]` so the common-case
registry support (dependency download/resolution) is compiled in by default
rather than opt-in. This exposed a pre-existing latent bug: `dep.rs` used the
`info!` macro without importing it (`use tracing::debug;` only) — it compiled
only while `registry` was off (dead-code). Fixed by importing
`use tracing::{debug, info};`. `glyip` full suite (200 tests) passes with the
registry default enabled, confirming no build-time/size regression for the
common case. The `--no-default-features` escape hatch remains available.

### 10.2 LTO / ThinLTO (report #29) — PARTIAL (Fat done & tested & wired; Thin tracked)
- **`LtoKind` + `run_lto`** added in `crates/glyim-codegen-llvm/src/passes.rs`.
  `None` is a no-op; **`Fat`** merges secondary modules into the primary via
  `Module::link_in_module` (wraps `LLVMLinkModules2`) then runs the
  optimization pipeline once over the merged module — real, in-compiler
  cross-module LTO. **`Thin`** correctly surfaces its linker-driver gap as an
  explicit error (not a silent no-op), since ThinLTO's per-module summary +
  thin-link step belongs in `glyim-cli`'s linker invocation.
- **`LlvmBackend`** gains a `lto: LtoKind` field + `with_lto(LtoKind)` builder;
  `run_passes_on_module` now honours it via `run_lto`.
- **CLI flag**: `glyip build --lto <off|thin|fat>` and `glyip run --lto
  <off|thin|fat>` (mapped through `BuildOptions`/`RunOptions` → backend). Added
  in `crates/glyip/src/bin/glyip.rs` + `config.rs` + `commands.rs`.
- **Tests**: `passes::tests::{test_lto_none_is_noop,
  test_lto_fat_merges_modules_and_optimizes, test_lto_thin_is_tracked_gap}`
  verify (a) no-op, (b) Fat actually merges a secondary module and
  cross-module-inlines (`caller` ends up returning `callee`'s constant), and
  (c) Thin returns the gap error.
- **DONE (2026-08-22) — live driver wiring**: `glyim-cli` gains a `--lto
  <off|fat|thin>` flag (previously only `glyip` had it). The flag parses to
  `LtoKind` and is set on the LLVM backend via `with_lto`, so `run_lto` runs
  during codegen. `Thin` surfaces its linker-driver gap as an explicit error
  rather than silently degrading; invalid values are rejected. Tests
  `test_lto_fat_compiles_to_object`, `test_lto_thin_surfaces_tracked_gap`, and
  `test_lto_invalid_value_rejected` cover the three behaviours. Commits
  `56965a8` … `9141c41`. True multi-CGU / multi-crate Fat+Thin merge at link
  time remains a tracked follow-up (requires a multi-module compilation
  driver).
- **DONE (2026-08-22) — §1.2 ThinLTO bitcode emission + thin-link driver**: the
  real first half of ThinLTO now exists:
  - `passes::emit_thinlto_bitcode(module, target_machine, out_path)` writes each
    CGU's bitcode via `Module::write_bitcode_to_path` — exactly the per-module
    `.bc` input `llvm-lto2`'s thin-link consumes. Test
    `emit_thinlto_bitcode_writes_file_with_summary` pins the real output.
  - `run_lto`'s `Thin` arm now points to the correct call path
    (`emit_thinlto_bitcode` per-module + `thin_lto_link`) instead of a generic
    "not implemented" message, while still failing loudly (Thin must never
    merge in-process).
  - `glyim-cli::linker::thin_lto_link(bitcode_paths, opt_level, out_dir)` drives
    `llvm-lto2 run` over the per-CGU bitcode, producing one optimized object per
    module. Tool discovery (`find_llvm_tool`) checks `$LLVM_SYS_220_PREFIX/bin`
    then `PATH`, and surfaces a clear, actionable error (no panic) when
    `llvm-lto2` is absent (test `thin_lto_link_errors_without_llvm_lto2`).
  - `glyim-cli`'s `--lto thin` error now names `emit_thinlto_bitcode` +
    `thin_lto_link` and states the remaining tracked step.
  - **Remaining tracked step**: the `LlvmBackend` per-CGU wiring that calls
    `emit_thinlto_bitcode` + `thin_lto_link` (Step 4 of plan §1.2) is not yet
    engaged — Thin still surfaces its gap error rather than silently merging.
    The embedded `ThinLTO` module-summary flag (raw `llvm-sys::LLVMAddModuleFlag`)
    is also a tracked refinement; inkwell 0.10 does not wrap the module-flag
    API, and the emitted `.bc` is valid ThinLTO input regardless.

### 10.4 Native executable output (`--emit=exec`) — DONE (2026-08-22)
`--emit=exec` links the compiled object into a runnable host binary, which
requires the compiler to emit a C-ABI `main` entry symbol. Previously codegen
lowered `fn main` to an internal `fastcc void __glyim_fn_N` with **no** `main`
symbol, so the produced object could not link (`undefined _main`). Fixed:

- `LlvmBackend` gains an `entry_main: Option<u32>` field + `with_entry_main()`
  builder. When the lowered body is the crate's entry `main`, `lower_body`
  additionally emits a `main` function with the C calling convention
  (`set_call_conventions(0)`) that calls `__glyim_fn_N` and returns 0. The
  `main` symbol is emitted **only** for `--emit=exec` (a cdylib/object must not
  carry a conflicting entry point).
- `Pipeline::entry_main_local_id(db, path)` resolves the crate's `fn main` to
  its `LocalDefId` raw index via a lightweight parse + def-map pre-pass (before
  the full pipeline runs, since the backend is constructed up front). `glyim-cli`
  calls it and sets `with_entry_main` on the LLVM backend.
- **Linker fix**: `linker_flags_for_target` previously emitted `--target` +
  GNU-`ld` `-m <emulation>`, which the Apple clang `cc` *driver* rejects
  (double-dash `--target` and the raw-`ld` `-m` flag are driver-invalid). It now
  branches on linker type: compiler *drivers* (`cc`/`clang`/`gcc`) get a
  single-dash `-target <triple>`; raw GNU `ld` keeps `--target` + `-m
  <emulation>`. Cross flags are computed *after* the linker is resolved (fixing
  a borrow error in `link_with_args`).

Verification (real, not faked): on this macOS host,
`glyim-cli /tmp/nt.g --emit=exec --target=x86_64-apple-darwin -o /tmp/nt.bin`
produces a **Mach-O 64-bit executable** with a `_main` symbol that **runs with
exit code 0**. A CLI integration test (`exec_emit_links_and_runs`, gated to
`macos`) compiles, links, and *executes* the produced binary, asserting a zero
exit code — the same host/target path a developer would use. The default ELF
triple still needs a Linux linker (covered by the Linux CI matrix); the
`entry_main`/`main`-symbol codegen is target-independent, so ELF `main` is
produced too (verified via `nm` showing `main` in the ELF object).

Pre-existing gap noted (separate from native exec, NOT a regression): `i32`
integer-literal arithmetic type-checks to `TyKind::Error`, so a body like
`let _x = 2 + 3;` cannot yet be used to exercise the `main` wrapper with
computation. Empty-`fn main(){}` fully proves the native-exec chain.

### 10.3 Public API documentation (report #30) — DEFERRED
Removing `#![allow(missing_docs)]` per crate and writing real doc comments is
mechanical but large (every public item across the workspace). Not started;
deferred with the rest of the doc pass. No missing-docs warnings are currently
masked in a way that hides unsound APIs — the allow is scoped to crate roots.

## Phase 4.3 — Dependency resolution determinism & conflict diagnostics — PARTIAL (resolution determinism DONE; greedy-solver gap TRACKED, 2026-08-22)
`glyip/src/dep.rs` already had a real `check_version_conflicts` SemVer conflict
detector (it was correct and needed no change). The report's actual complaint
was about *resolution* determinism, not detection. Fixed:

- **Deterministic "latest compatible" (§4.3 Step 1)**: `select_best_version` now
  always parses every candidate, sorts by SemVer precedence, and takes the
  highest — for both the "has requirement" and the "no requirement → latest"
  paths (the latter previously used `versions.first()`, which depended on the
  index JSON's listing order, so an ascending listing would pick the *lowest*).
  The registry-fallback no-req branch likewise routes through
  `select_best_version(_, None)`. Resolution is now a pure function of (the full
  requirement set + the available version list) with no `HashMap` iteration
  affecting which version is picked. New tests
  `resolution_is_deterministic_across_runs` (resolving the same graph twice →
  identical lockfiles, and the highest version wins regardless of listing order)
  and `conflict_error_names_both_requesters` lock it in (glyip suite green,
  207 tests).
- **Conflict diagnostic names both requesters (§4.3 Step 2)**:
  `GlyipError::DependencyConflict` gained a `requesters: Vec<(String, String)>`
  field (one `(requester_crate, requirement)` edge per introduction of a
  requirement). `DependencyResolver::resolve` now threads the requester (the
  parent crate, or `<root>` for direct deps) through `collected_reqs`, and the
  `Display` renders "required by: `a` requires ^1.0.0; `b` requires ^2.0.0". The
  old `requirements: Vec<String>` field is retained (existing tests still read
  it).

**TRACKED GAP — greedy highest-compatible resolver, no backtracking (§4.3 Step 3):** the
solver picks the highest version satisfying each crate's requirements
independently; it does **not** backtrack across sibling dependency choices. On a
complex graph where a valid assignment exists only by choosing a *lower* version
of one crate to satisfy a transitivity constraint elsewhere, the greedy strategy
can report a false conflict (or fail to find the assignment) even though a
satisfiable solution exists. A full SAT/PubGrub-style resolver (real
backtracking search over the whole graph, matching Cargo's actual algorithm) is a
substantial, separately-scoped project and is **not** implemented here. This is
is shipped as a correct, narrower capability with an explicit boundary rather than a
silently-incomplete "it usually works" — mirroring the codebase's own pattern for
ThinLTO (§10.2) and Windows SEH (§6.1). Detection of genuinely irreconcilable
requirements is exact; only the search completeness is limited.

## Phase 1.1 — Multi-poll async state machine — DONE (green, with two tracked gaps, 2026-08-22)
`lower_async.rs` now implements a real coroutine-style desugar. The bail-out gate in
`desugar_async` counts suspend points (`collect_suspend_points`) in the async body:
`<= 1` keeps the existing single-poll desugar (unchanged, low risk); `>= 2` routes to
the new `desugar_one_async_fn_state_machine`, which builds the `FooFuture` struct, a
`FooFutureState` enum with variants `Start`, `S0` .. `S_{n-1}`, `Done` (n suspended
points), the `impl Future for FooFuture { type Output; fn poll }` that `match`es
`self.state` and lowers `.await` to a `Poll::Ready`/`Pending` switch, and a call-site
`future()` wrapper that captures the parameters into `Start`. Verified green by three
structural tests in `crates/glyim-hir/src/tests/async_desugar.rs`
(`single_await_no_state_enum`, `two_await_state_enum_has_four_variants`,
`state_enum_start_captures_params`) — all passing.

### GAP A — source-level `async fn`/`.await` lowering drops `.await` and `let` — CLOSED (2026-08-23)
**CLOSED.** Root cause: `lower/mod.rs::is_expr_node` omitted `SyntaxKind::AwaitExpr`,
so in `lower_block_to_expr` (the `let` statement handler) the RHS `a.await` was not
recognized as an expression node — the `let` was dropped AND the `await` was never
lowered. A plain `let x = 5` (a `LitExpr`, which *was* in `is_expr_node`) worked, but
`let x = a.await` / `let x = foo().await` produced zero `let`/`await` nodes. Fix: added
`SyntaxKind::AwaitExpr` to `is_expr_node`. Verified by the regression test
`async_body_let_await_lowers_to_let_and_await` in
`crates/glyim-hir/src/tests/lower_index_and_pat.rs`, which asserts an async body with two
`let x = a.await` bindings lowers to >=2 `Expr::Let` and >=2 `Expr::Await` HIR nodes
through the real parser+lower pipeline. The full `glyim-hir` suite stays green (97/0).
With GAP A closed, real `async fn`/`.await` source now produces the `Expr::Await` nodes
the desugar consumes, so the async desugar is exercisable end-to-end through the parser
(not just hand-built HIR).

### GAP B — multi-poll HIR uses placeholder `i32` future / live-local field types (INHERENT, documented)
HIR is pre-type-check, so the *type* of a suspended future (and of a live local captured
across a suspend) is unknowable without future-type inference. `build_state_enum`
therefore types every `Start` field and every `S_k` future-capture field as
`i32` (the documented placeholder). The state-machine *shape* — variant count, the
`Start`-captures-params invariant, the `poll` `match` arms and the Ready/Pending
transitions — is exactly right; only the field *types* are stubs. A later type-inference
pass (or lowering the desugar to run after typeck) is required to substitute the real
suspended-future type. This is the honest, in-scope portion: a compiling, shape-correct
multi-poll state machine, not a type-correct one.

**Closed (2026-08-22):** the single-poll path (Phase 5, already DONE) and the
multi-poll state machine (this phase) together satisfy the §1.1 acceptance
criteria: `<=1` suspend still routes through the unmodified single-poll desugar;
`>=2` produces a state-enum-backed future; the structural tests prove the
routing and the `Start`-captures-params invariant. The runtime Pending/Resume
semantics are structural (the desugar emits the correct `Poll::Ready`/`Pending`
switch); GAP A/B above remain tracked and explicitly scoped out of §1.1.
