## Guidelines

- **E05xx** (Gate infrastructure) vs semantic gate failure: `Err(E05xx)`
  means the gate could not run at all. `Ok(GateResult { passed: false })`
  means the gate ran but found violations. Never conflate these.

- **E02xx** (Apply) errors are recoverable via rollback. E0206 specifically
  indicates a partial apply was detected and all changes were reverted.

- **E03xx** (Security) errors indicate path traversal attempts and should
  be logged at WARN level for security auditing.
