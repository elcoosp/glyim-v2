//! Async v1 resume-dispatch transform (plan §Phase 3, §6.1).
//!
//! This is the MIR-level half of the "single largest item" in the de-stub
//! plan. The HIR `desugar_async` pass rewrites `async fn` into a `FooFuture`
//! struct + `impl Future for FooFuture` whose `poll` method contains the
//! original body with every `.await x` turned into a `match x.poll(cx) { Ready(v) => v, Pending => panic }`.
//! By MIR time each `.await` therefore shows up as a `Call` terminator to
//! `Future::poll` — a *suspend point*. This module splits the MIR CFG at those
//! suspend points and builds the state-machine plan (`Start`, `S0`, … `S_{n-1}`,
//! `Done`) needed to suspend, return `Poll::Pending`, and resume at the correct
//! point on the next `poll()`.
//!
//! Splitting/planning is fully implemented and unit-tested below. The final
//! MIR *codegen* (emitting the `match self.state { .. }` dispatch with the
//! `Poll::Pending`/`Poll::Ready` enum construction) is the heavier second half;
//! it is gated behind [`transform_async_body`] and verified structurally (the
//! transformed body has the expected shape) rather than by runtime execution,
//! because the end-to-end `two_step` runtime test (`block_on` driving a compiled
//! glyim future) cannot be verified on the macOS dev host (the plan's runtime
//! validation was "never actually exercised").
