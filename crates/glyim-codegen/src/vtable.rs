//! VTable layout constants and utilities for code generation backends.
//!
//! A vtable is a structure in memory containing pointers to the concrete
//! implementations of the methods of a trait, plus metadata for drop, size,
//! and alignment. The layout is:
//!
//! | Offset              | Content                       |
//! |---------------------|-------------------------------|
//! | 0 * ptr_size        | drop function pointer         |
//! | 1 * ptr_size        | size (usize)                  |
//! | 2 * ptr_size        | align (usize)                 |
//! | 3 * ptr_size + ...  | method pointers               |
