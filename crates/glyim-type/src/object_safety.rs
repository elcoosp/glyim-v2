//! Object safety checks for traits used as `dyn Trait`.
//!
//! A trait is object-safe if:
//! 1. It does not require `Self: Sized` (explicitly or implicitly).
//! 2. All methods have receivers that can be dispatched (i.e., take `self` by reference
//!    or by value where `Self: Sized` is not required).
//! 3. No method has generic type parameters.
//! 4. All associated types are constrained (mentioned) by at least one method signature,
//!    so they can be resolved through the trait object's vtable.
//! 5. All supertraits are themselves object-safe (computed by the caller, since this
//!    module deliberately avoids depending on trait-resolution machinery).
