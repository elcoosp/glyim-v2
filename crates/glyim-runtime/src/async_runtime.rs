//! Minimal single-threaded async executor (Phase 5 MVP).
//!
//! This is the `block_on`-style poll-to-completion executor described in the
//! unstub-5 plan (§5.2). It drives a [`Future`] to completion by repeatedly
//! calling [`Future::poll`] until it yields [`Poll::Ready`].
//!
//! The `Future`/`Poll`/`Context`/`Waker` model mirrors `glyim-lang-core/lib/
//! future.g` so that, once `async fn`/`.await` desugaring lands in the
//! compiler front-end, the generated state machines can be driven by this
//! exact loop. Until then, the no-op `Waker` keeps the executor correct for
//! straight-line futures that become `Ready` on the first poll or after a
//! bounded number of polls.
//!
//! A real multi-threaded waker and an I/O reactor are tracked follow-ups
//! (see `docs/plans/v0.1.0/unstub-5/KNOWN_GAPS.md` Phase 5).
